            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Not in ſuch haſte as not to return your good Morrow. But yet to tell you the Truth, I am ſo ſollicited for my Vote for next Election of Parliament-men for our City, that I am reſolved now to diſpoſe of it; that being engaged, I may be freed from further Solicitation: And becauſe I have a mind to diſpoſe of it well, (though I am told all the Candidates are honeſt Gentlemen) I was going to ask the Parſon's Advice.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John.</speaker>
               <p>A <hi>Highflyer,</hi> pray, What is that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adam.</speaker>
               <p>Neighbour, I am no Univerſity Scholar, and therefore I'll not pretend to make a formal Definition as our Parſon does ſometimes. But I'll tell you what, upon a good many Years Obſervation, I find to be the Character and Practice of a <hi>Highflyer;</hi> and I doubt not but you may have obſerv'd the ſame.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and the late King <hi>James,</hi> (who follow'd Popiſh and <hi>French</hi> Councils) the <hi>Highflyers</hi> preach'd up Paſſive Obedience to the Will of the King; they were for ſetting up the King's Prerogative above Law, that he might allow them to Domineer over their Pariſhioners. They were warm in the perſecuting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters, who differ from the Church of <hi>England</hi> only in ſome few indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ceremonies, but would let alone the Papiſts, who differ from them in Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Points of Faith. When the late King <hi>William</hi> came to the Crown, and was the Inſtrument, in the Hand of God, to ſave us from Popery and <hi>French</hi> Slavery, they would never be reconcil'd to him, becauſe he was for Toleration of the Proteſtant Diſſenters; and for the ſame reaſon they continue their Clamours againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Queen, and endeavour to affright People with an Opinion, that the Church is in Danger, becauſe ſhe will not help them to break the Toleration Act. The <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyers</hi> are for ſetting up the Clergy as an Independent State from that of Lords and Commons: The <hi>Highflyers</hi> are for Eſtabliſhing to the Clergy a Power above that of the Civil Magiſtrate; and have down right quarrel'd with our Archbiſhop, and other our Biſhops, (Men of Temper, Piety, Learning, and Moderation) becauſe they have thwarted theſe their pernicious Deſigns in their Convocation: The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171259:2"/>between the <hi>Highflying</hi> Parſons and the Biſhops in Convocation, are what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you and I do not well underſtand, and therefore I'll ſay no more of that: But you and I may plainly ſee and obſerve, That in all Elections of Parliament-men du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the late King <hi>William</hi>'s Reign, and now in Her Majeſty's Reign, the <hi>Highflying Parſons</hi> always made an Intereſt, and voted for the ſame Perſons as the Papiſts, Nonjurors and Jacobites, have voted for: And therefore I'll never take the Advice of a <hi>Highflying Parſon</hi> in the caſe of Elections for Parliament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you ſpeak of Jacobites? I was told there were no Jacobites left ſince the late King <hi>James</hi> died.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adam.</speaker>
               <p>Our Parſon, indeed, told us ſo t'other Day at the..... But what think you of thoſe, who within 18 Months paſt fell foul upon the Government, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to the Emperor an inconſiderable Sum (and that, but a little while before it would become due by Treaty) to Remount his Cavalry, and Recruit his Troops, which were to ſerve in <hi>Italy:</hi> As alſo to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to put his Affairs in good Order at <hi>Turin,</hi> then threaten'd to be beſieged by the <hi>French.</hi> And yet it was then very well known that it was to the Advance of theſe two Sums, together with the Money lent upon the <hi>Sileſia</hi> Fund, that we owed the Defence of <hi>Turin,</hi> the Victory obtained by Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> over the <hi>French</hi> there, the Raiſing of that Siege, and recovering all that Part of <hi>Italy</hi> from the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what think you of the Preparation made of Horſe in ſome Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and of Arms in <hi>Seotland,</hi> againſt the late intended <hi>French</hi> Invaſion? And do you think the <hi>French</hi> would have made that Attempt with a handful of Men, if they had not been aſſured of Friends in <hi>Great Britain?</hi> Tell me alſo, if you did not obſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> among the Nonjurors and their Friends, as long as the late Invaſion was expected to take place? And have you ſeen no Melancholy Looks among them, ſince the Pretender and his <hi>French</hi> Fleet were by Sir <hi>George Bing</hi>'s driven off from the Coaſt of <hi>Scotland?</hi> And then tell me, If you believe there are no <hi>Jacobites</hi> left in <hi>Great Britain?</hi> I might add the many Nonjurors Houſes (for I omit mentioning the Papiſts) where the Prayers of our Church are daily uſed; but where inſtead of the Prayer for the Queen, and any Branch of the Proteſtant Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the pretended Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> is pray'd for by the Title of King <hi>James</hi> III. And during the late expected Invaſion, there were many repeated Prayers made in Publick (by Perſons who are not Nonjurors) for Succeſs to a young Gentleman go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dangerous Voyage. Many more ſignificant Inſtances I could give you, too long for this Paper. But I think I have ſaid enough to ſatisfy you, That there are <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> ſtill in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> All the Highflying High-Church Notions border upon Popery. And ſuch of the <hi>Highflyers</hi> as pretend not to be <hi>Jacobites,</hi> are the moſt dangerous: For whatever they may pretend, all their Meaſures tend that way, and they many times lead many well-meaning People into the like Meaſures, which in their Conſequences are to the Advantage of the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Popiſh Pretender. And believe me, thoſe Perſons who would perſwade you that there are no <hi>Jacobites</hi> but the Papiſts, are blinding your Eyes; and endeavour to amuſe you, with telling you the Church is in Danger,— only that they may with the more eaſe compaſs what they call a Reſtoration;— which in Truth is nothing leſs than a Popiſh Pretended King with a <hi>French</hi> Power, from which, <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi> Such Men whilſt they tell you, That (Papiſts excepted) there are no <hi>Jacobites</hi> left; Act the ſame Part as <hi>Zebul</hi> did, when he told <hi>Gaal....</hi> in the Books of <hi>Judges.</hi>— Thou ſeeſt the Shadow of Mountains as if they were Men.— But <hi>Zebul</hi> knew in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:171259:2"/>Truth that it was <hi>Abimelech</hi> and his Men, with whom <hi>Zebul</hi> preſently joined, to deſtroy <hi>Gaal</hi> and the City of <hi>Shechem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I have run too far from my Point: My Notion, Neighbour, is, That the Papiſts, Nonjurors and Jacobites, eſteem that to be Good, which I call Evil and Deſtruction to the Proteſtant Religion, and Happineſs of <hi>England.</hi>— They hope and endeavour to have the Popiſh Pretender <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> upon the Throne of <hi>Great Britain:</hi> All their Actions tend to this, however ſome of them deceive us by acting more cunningly and cautiouſly than others of them; but I am ſure none of them can deſire to chooſe into Parliament, ſuch Gentlemen as are fitteſt to ſupport the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Queen <hi>ANNE,</hi> and the Proteſtant Succeſſion: And therefore, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Character of the Gentlemen who ſtand Candidates for being choſen into Parliament, be otherwiſe Equal, ſo it be indifferent to me which of them be choſen,— This ſhall be my Rule, I'll always be againſt the Man whoſe Intereſt is eſpouſed by the Papiſts, Nonjurors or Jacobites.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John.</speaker>
               <p>But may not you and I, who are of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well ſay, We will be againſt the Man whom the Proteſtant Diſſenters are for, for they are not Friends to our Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adam.</speaker>
               <p>No Neighbour, the Caſe is very different: For though the Proteſtant Diſſenters think their Way of Worſhip better than ours; yet as I ſaid before, they agree with us in the ſame Articles of Faith, and differ from us only in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; and they are not ſo far Enemies to our Church, as to wiſh it deſtroy'd;— nor is it their Intereſt it ſhould be ſo; for the Presbyterians, Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts and Quakers, do all know they live happier under the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Toleration, than they ſhould under either of thoſe Parties if uppermoſt. And as they can never agree amongſt themſelves which of thoſe Parties ſhould be the Eſtabliſhed Church, as Experience hath ſhewed us.— It is the Intereſt of every one of thoſe Parties to deſire and endeavour the Support of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Church by Law eſtabliſh'd. And Intereſt will not Lie. Beſides they are united with us in the ſame common Intereſt againſt a <hi>French</hi> Government, againſt Popery, againſt a Popiſh Pretended Prince, and for the Good and Peace of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in the Proteſtant Succeſſion. Whereas it is the Intereſt of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to deſtroy our Church and the Proteſtant Religion; it is the Intereſt, as well as the Endeavour of Papiſt, Nonjurors and Jacobites— That the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould get the Better of us, and Eſtabliſh the Popiſh Pretender as King of theſe Realms. And you ſee the Pope did not only make Publick Prayers for Succeſs in the late intended Invaſion, but alſo furniſh'd a vaſt Sum of Money out of his own Coffers, to help the <hi>French</hi> King and the Pretended Prince, to carry on that Deſign.</p>

               <speaker>John.</speaker>
               <p>I like your Reaſoning very well; and as you have more Years and more Experience than I have, I ſhall be glad to have your Advice upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Adam.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Neighbour, I'll be very free in telling you plainly my Thoughts, which in general, are always to pitch upon the beſt of thoſe who offer themſelves to be choſen. But more Particularly,— I would look after a Man of good Morals: And if among thoſe who offer themſelves to be choſen, there be one of whoſe Steadineſs in Parliament to the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> you have had any Trial, I would chuſe that Man I would chuſe Men of viſible Eſtates, and then if their Abilities prove ſuch, that the Government ſhould think fit to put them into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171259:3"/>Employments, you are ſecure they will not be ſo eaſily Byaſt to forſake the true Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> if ever a Court Adminiſtration takes wrong Meaſures; as ſuch Perſons may be, who have little or nothing to Live upon but the Favour of the Court. The Stake which a Man has in <hi>England</hi> by his Eſtate, is to them who chuſe him, a Security for his good Behaviour in Parliament. I would chuſe Men of Revolution Principles, ſuch as ſhewed upon all Occaſions that they were hearty for the Support of the Revolution under the late King <hi>William,</hi> hearty for Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Government of Queen <hi>ANNE,</hi> and of the Proteſtant Succeſſion. Theſe Things I look upon as Principal Foundations; and if ever you have Gentlemen offering themſelves to your Choice, whoſe Characters and Conditions are ſuch as anſwer your Wiſhes in all theſe aforemention'd Reſpects.— I would in the next place chuſe Men of Experience in Parliamentary Affairs, rather than ſuch who know nothing of the Matter. I would chuſe Men of known Ability in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For really, Neighbour, we receive a Benefit in our own private Trade and Way of Living, by having ſuch Repreſentatives, as well as the Publick. And I have been aſſured by very knowing Men, That the Two Members which are choſen for our City, have oftentimes by their able Speaking in Parliament, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Things which were good for the Trade of our City, and prevented Miſchiefs which we ſhould have felt, if our Repreſentatives had not been able to ſpeak for us in the Houſe of Commons. And much more may we ſuffer in Publick National Affairs, if we don't chuſe Men that have Ability to Debate and Reaſon in that Aſſembly. And, believe me Neighbour, there is a great deal of Difference between an Ability to talk to our Comrades, as you and I do now, or for Gentlemen to talk to us their Inferiors, or Diſcourſe in a Coffee-houſe.— I ſay there is a great deal of Difference between that ſort of Ability, and between a Capacity to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Argue in ſuch an Aſſembly as the Houſe of Commons. In the next Place, I would chuſe Men of our own Country, for they are moſt likely to know what our Intereſt is, and to take care of it. Theſe are General Rules, from which there may be ſome Exceptions; for you ſometimes ſee Men of very ſmall Eſtates have as much Integrity, and leſs Ambition, than ſome Men of greater Fortunes. And the experienced Virtue of ſome Gentlemen has deſervedly engaged ſome Cities, Burroughs and Corporations, to chuſe them into Parliament, though they lived at <hi>London,</hi> or other Parts of <hi>England</hi> very Remote, and have no Eſtates in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties where they are choſen.</p>
               <p>But there is one Error we are apt to run into: Namely, to Vote for this or t'other Man, becauſe he Buys at our Shop, Employs us at Work, or Treats us with good Drink: And in the mean time we ſuffer infinitely more by the Miſchief done to the Publick, through our Repreſentatives want of Integrity or Ability, than what thoſe aformentioned private Advantages can make us amends for. Therefore whenever-you go to Elections of Parliament-men, lay aſide all private Conſiderations, and chuſe ſuch Men as are fitteſt, and beſt able to Repreſent you: For 'tis the Welfare of the whole Nation depends upon the good Choice of a Parliament, and your Liberties, Properties and Well-being, are all included therein.</p>
